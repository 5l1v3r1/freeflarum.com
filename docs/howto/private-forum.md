# Private forum

You may want to run a forum to discuss with friends, and not have everything out in the open. With Flarum, that is actually surprisingly easy.

First, create accounts for all your friends/members. 
You can:
1. Open up multiple Incognito Tab sessions (Chrome: control-shift-N to open new Incognito session) and register multiple accounts for each of the person you want to access your forum with their email and a password you choose for them (they can change their password later).
2. Let them register the accounts for themselves. If some stranger for some reason registered an account on your forum and you don't want that, you can delete his/her account later.

Once you registered a couple of FreeFlarum accounts for your friends, go to Flarum > Administration and change the permission for "view discussions" to "members only".

Also be sure to change "Signup" to "Closed". You will have to add new members manually by using steps we mentioned above. 

Occassional visitors will now see an empty forum. You can again verify that with your browser in Incognito mode.
